<h2>Ridge's Top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<p>I love this movies because of how stongly it expresses the idea of independence and freedom</p>
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>This movie has been my favorite anime since the 90's</p>
<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>This movie is an excellent example of how to structure a movie around its plot. It's about two rival magicians and the strucure of a magic trick. Once you finish the movie, you realize the whole movie was a trick to fool the veiwer</p>
